## Overview of the analysis: 
The purpose of this analysis was to compile data from an SQLite database about the weather in Hawaii specifically in June and December. 

## Results: 
- The temperatures collected in June include the data recorded from 2010 to 2017. So in summarizing that data, its found that the average temperature in June for the past 7 years is around 74 degrees fahrenheit. The max temperature is 84 and the minimum temperature is 64. The standard deviation is around three degrees. 
- Since this data is about opening an ice cream shop, the june temperature show that the weather is June remains stable around 75 degrees which is how enough tto have sales.
- The tempertures collected in December show that the average temperature for December from 2010 to 2017 is about 71 degrees. The minimum temperature is 56 degrees and the max temperature is 83 degrees. 
- The December data shows that temperatures vary more in December since the range between the minimum and maximum temperatures is 27 degrees. However the standard deviation is about 4 degrees and so 50% of temperatures collected is around 71 degrees and 1 standard deviation away is 69 degrees. Therefore the weather is still more likely to be able to uphold the ice cream sales. 

## Summary: 
In summary, it seems that the store can maintain sales in June and December which are two different times of year that can help reflect the weather changes within a year since it also comes from seven years of data. Two other quareies that can be done to get more data on the June and Decemeber, one is inquiring about the stations from which the temperatures are being observed from in order to ensure that the data is validated. Another query is to inquire the trend in the temperature leading up to and from June and Devember in order to see if there cound be a dip in temperature that could affect ice cream sales.
